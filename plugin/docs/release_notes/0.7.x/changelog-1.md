## What's New

#### Fetch Data From Python As JSON (experimental)
To get rid of custom parsing code, nearly all data is now fetched from Python as a JSON string.
This also affects the fetching of the rendered HTML, generated by pandas, for a chunk.

Switching from HTML to a custom JSON format may cause some problems.
This is the reason why this feature is implemented with a feature switch. 
It is enabled by default. If you disable the feature, the HTML will be loaded as before.

>In case you run into any problem please let me know and open an issue on GitHub.
It is planned to switch completely to JSON in one of the next versions, this depends on feedback.

To switch back to the old behavior, you have to open the settings dialog, select *IntelliJ IDEA | Preferences* for macOS or *File | Settings* for Windows and Linux.
Alternatively, press `Ctrl+Alt+S`.

Under the section `Tools` you will find the entry `Styled DataFrame Viewer`.
The feature switch is called: `Use new data structure when loading chunks`
