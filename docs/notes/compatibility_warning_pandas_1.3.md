# The Plugin Doesn't Support [pandas version 1.3](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/milestone/80) (not yet)

The plugin will not work with the upcoming pandas version 1.3. This is because the plugin uses private methods of the pandas library.

Unfortunately it seems to be very difficult to provide the features of this plugin without using private parts of the library. Therefore, I expect that we will have to adjust things from time to time.

So, let's wait for pandas 1.3.
