## What's New

#### Initial Support For pandas 1.3
All already by the plugin supported `Styler` methods are now also usable with pandas 1.3. Some of them gotten additional parameters, which are also supported.
- `Styler.apply`
- `Styler.applymap`
- `Styler.background_gradient`
- `Styler.format`
- `Styler.highlight_max`
- `Styler.highlight_min`
- `Styler.highlight_null`
- `Styler.set_properties`

And the following new ones, added in pandas 1.3, are also on board:
- `Styler.highlight_between`
- `Styler.highlight_quantile`
- `Styler.text_gradient`

#### Reworked Table Header For Multi Index DataFrames
Reworked parsing and rendering of the table header to improve the handling of multi index `DataFrames`.

Index names of multi index `DataFrames` are now included in the header tooltip. Before it was not possible to see this information.

### Reduced Size Of Generated HTML
The size of the on python side generated html has been reduced. Unused information are now excluded which can reduce the size of the html generated by `Styler::render()`. The reduction depends on the used styling.

### Beta Status Hint Removed
A lot of code was rewritten under the hood in the last two versions of the plugin in order to create better testing possibilities. Almost all previously manual tests are now automated.
